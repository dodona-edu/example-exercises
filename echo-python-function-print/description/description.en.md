Write a function `echo` that always **prints** what is passed as a parameter to the function.

![echo cave](media/Echo_Caves.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

### Output

The same text is printed that is given between the brackets of the function.

### Example

{: .callout.callout-info}
> #### Example notation
> To make a clear distinction between input and output in the example below, the input is preceded by three major characters and a space (`>>>`). Furthermore, that notation has no meaning. The output is against the left margin.

```python
>>> echo("Hello world!")
"Hello world!"
>>> echo(5)
5
```
